Hello, we hope you find myshell intuitive, well-organized, and of
course, bug-free.

===== Design Choices ================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. First and Foremost: myshell allows input from the current working directory,
(in addition to the three bin folders). Whether or not this is allowed is not clear in 
the writeup. However, allowing input from the cwd increases functionality and improves 
the user experience. We are trying to mimic a real shell, after all. We stand by our 
decision knowing that we have accomplished the point of the project, but went further 
to create a well-rounded final result. 

2. Input clean-up: The input line gets tokenized, trimmed, and counted before going 
anywhere else. Global variable MAX_TOKENS is set and used often throughout the program.

3. Master Directory: The Master Directory is the heart of our program. All input gets 
passed through this function and gets redirected to their expected targets. If the 
end of the directory is reached, it can be assumed that there is a user error.

4. Structure: You will notice that mysh.c is organized into sections relating to
general functions. For example, there is a "built-in commands" section, a "redirection"
section, and an "input proccessing" section, to name a few. A "helper function" section
at the top of the program contains functions that many of the sections call often.

5. Global Variables: char** tokens contains all of the tokens the user entered. This
does not change until the while loop finishes that iteration. However, char** arguments 
is changed everytime a <, >, or | symbol, is found. 'arguments' contains the active 
argument list unique to the <, >, or | symbol that is being executed. Keeping a unique,
global argument list allows us to easily pass it into execv() anywhere in the program.
